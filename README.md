Medicore: The Smooth Prescription Handling Workflow

## About The Project âœ¨
Medicore is a web-based platform designed to bridge the communication gap between customers needing prescriptions and their local pharmacists. Traditionally, customers have to physically visit a pharmacy to check for medicine availability, which can be time-consuming. This project provides a simple and efficient workflow where customers can submit their prescription list online, and pharmacists can provide real-time feedback on the availability of the medicines.
The core of the application is a dedicated chat and status update system for each prescription request, ensuring a clear and direct line of communication.

## Key Features
Dual User Roles: Separate, tailored dashboards and functionalities for Customers and Pharmacists.

Secure Authentication: A complete user registration, login, and session management system.

Prescription Submission: A simple interface for customers to submit their list of required medicines.

Real-Time Chat: A dedicated, live chat for each prescription request, allowing pharmacists to communicate directly with customers.

Pharmacist Queue: A dashboard for pharmacists that organizes all incoming "Pending" requests.

Live Status Updates: Pharmacists can update the request status to "Available" or "Unavailable," which is reflected in real-time for the customer.

Request Management: Customers have the option to delete their submitted requests.
